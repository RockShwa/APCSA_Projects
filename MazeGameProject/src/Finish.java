	/** 
	 * FINISH CONSTRUCTOR
	 *  1. Place the location of the maze's finish on the board maintained in the parent class by invoking the MazeObject constructor.
	 *    	NOTE: Remember that on the board the y coordinate should be entered before the x coordinate
	 *    		since 2D arrays take the row first and then the column.
	 *    
	 *    	EXAMPLE: If your finish has a x coordinate of 40 and a y coordinate of 0 on the GUI,
	 *    		the position of finish should be (0/UNIT, 40/UNIT) or (0, 1) on the 2D array called board.
	 *    
	 *    	TYPE: We will use 4 to denote the Finish on the board.  
	 * 
	 *  2. Initialize myPosX, myPosY,mySize, and myColor for this Finish.
	 *  
	 * NEXT STEP: 
	 *  Click the link to go to the draw method and complete its implementation {@link #draw()}
	 *  
	 * @param x		x-coordinate of the object's location
	 * @param y		y-coordinate of the object's location
	 * @param size	length/height of the object
	 * @param c		color of the object
