	 * 				As a result it should be declared as protected instead of private.
	 * 				We want one board for all maze objects (as opposed to one board per MazeObject).
	 *				Consequently, the board should be defined as static.
	 * 	2. Initialize the board as a new 2D int array.

	 * MAZE OBJECT CONSTRUCTOR NOTES
	 * 	Each MazeObject will have a location on the board as well as a type. Type can be one of five values: 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. 
	 * 	Type meanings are as follows:
	 * 		0 -	no object at this location
	 * 		1 - wall at this location
	 * 		2 - player at this location
	 * 		3 - trap at this location
	 * 		4 - finish at this location
	 *
	 * 
	 * CONSTRUCTOR IMPLEMENTATION
	 * 	1. Initialize the board at the given row and column to the given type of MazeObject.
	 * 
	 * 	2. Call the printBoard() method -- you will need to uncomment the method at the bottom of the file
	 * 
	 * NEXT STEP: 
	 *  Click the link to go to the Wall class and complete its implementation {@link Wall}	
	 * 
	 * @param row		the row of the board where the MazeObject will be created
	 * @param col		the column of the board where the MazeObject will be created
	 * @param type		indicates the type of the MazeObject
